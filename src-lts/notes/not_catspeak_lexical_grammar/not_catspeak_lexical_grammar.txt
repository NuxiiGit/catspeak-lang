Catspeak source code is stored as a sequence of Unicode characters using
UTF-8 encoding. This means that most text rendered in the GameMaker IDE or
an external text editor will be interpreted as individual characters. Unicode
character clusters (such as skin tone emojis) are an exception to this, and
are instead interpreted as multiple characters, depending on the size of the
cluster.

In order for the computer to understand what these characters mean, they first
need to be transformed into larger groups of characters called [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Lexical_token_and_lexical_tokenization).
The following sections will cover what each of these tokens are, and how they
are parsed.

# Whitespace

For the most part Catspeak is whitespace insensitive, ignoring any of the
following characters:

 - **Character tabulation** `'\t'` (U+0009)
 - **Line feed**            `'\n'` (U+000A)
 - **Line tabulation**      `'\v'` (U+000B)
 - **Form feed**            `'\f'` (U+000C)
 - **Carriage return**      `'\r'` (U+000D)
 - **Space**                       (U+0020)
 - **Next Line**                   (U+0085)

[Comments](#comments) are also ignored by the Catspeak parser.

# Comments

Comments in Catspeak are prefixed by `--`. This will ignore all of the
characters following it until a new line is reached:

```meow
-- this is a Catspeak comment!
```

Unlike GML, the Catspeak programming language **does not** include multi-line
comments. Use multiple comments instead:

```meow
-- comment
-- split
-- over multiple
-- lines
--
-- ~(￣▽￣)~*
```

# Identifiers

Mostly used for variable names; identifiers start with either a letter
(A&#8209;Z or a&#8209;z) or an underscore `_`, followed by a sequence of other
letters, numbers, or underscores.

Examples of valid identifiers are:
```meow
bag_pipes
oneShot
__IMPALA_666__
abc123XYZ
```

_Identifiers **can not** start with numbers, e.g. `1st` is not a valid identifier._
