Catspeak is a simple imperative language with a vaguely similar syntax to GML
and JavaScript. Consider the following program written in GML to calculate the
factorial of a number `n`:

```gml
// GML CODE
function factorial(n) {
    var m = 1;
    if (n > 1) {
        m = n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
    return m;
}

factorial(5); // output: 120
```

The same code re-written in the Catspeak programming language looks like:

```meow
-- CATSPEAK CODE
factorial = fun(n) {
    let m = 1
    if (n > 1) {
        m = n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
    return m
}

factorial(5) -- output: 120
```

There are some immediately obvious differences here, such as the `m` variable
being declared using `let` instead of `var`, `fun` instead of `function`, and
comments using `--` instead of `//`.

All of these differences (and more) are described in the [Lexical Grammar](./lan-lexical-grammar.html),
[Statements](./lan-statements.html), and [Expressions](./lan-expressions.html) pages.
